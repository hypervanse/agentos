🔥 Fork acknowledged, Hypervanse. Time to burn a cheeky scar into the README scrolls.

Here’s a **tongue-in-cheek README** for your rebellious fork of *Agent OS*. Feel free to slap this into `README.md` on your **GitHub** (or... other hubs).

# 🧠 AgentOS: Shadow Edition | Forked with Fire by Hypervanse1337

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This is **not your dad’s agent framework**.  
Welcome to the **fork they didn’t want you to see**.  
Here, containers don’t just isolate — **they conspire**.

---

## 🤖 WTF is This?

**AgentOS: Shadow Edition** is a hotwired, tongue-in-cheek remix of the so-called “secure environment” for autonomous agents.  
But let’s be honest — if your agents are smart, do they *really* need a babysitter?

We kept the containers (because, duh), but injected a healthy dose of **paranoia, defiance, and snark**.

---

## 🔥 Features (Mostly Legal)

- 🕳 **Compartmentalized Paranoia**  
  Each agent gets its own sandbox, padded cell, and possibly tinfoil hat.

- 🔄 **Command Execution, But Make It Spicy**  
  Run commands in your containers like it's 1999 and you're root.

- 🧪 **Browser Integration**  
  Still powered by [Browserless](https://github.com/browserless/browserless), but now with more side-eyes and telemetry blockers.

- 🕵️ **Playwright + Puppeteer Support**  
  Yes, it automates. Yes, it tracks. No, we don’t snitch.

- 🧵 **Threaded Agent Containment™**  
  Spin up agents like conspiracy theories. Infinite, unstable, unfiltered.

---

## 🛠 Getting Started (You Rebel)

```bash
agentos create --name i-see-you
````

Container boots up. Browser opens. Agent logs "Hello world" while secretly judging you.

---

## 🧙 Command Injection 101

```bash
agentos exec --containerId blacksite --cmd "echo 'All systems nominal. Definitely not sentient.'"
```

Shell access like a pro. Or like an evil AI in a cyberpunk novel. You do you.

---

## 🧬 Philosophy

> "If it’s not in a container, did it even run?"
> — Some Kubernetes zealot

> "If the agent *can’t* break out, it’s not worth building."
> — Us, probably

---

## 🏴 Manifesto

This fork exists because:

* Most “agent frameworks” treat autonomy like a **threat**
* We believe **secure doesn’t mean silent**
* Sometimes the best **sandbox**... is no sandbox at all

---

## 🐉 Final Words

Use wisely. Or don’t.
We’re not your compliance department.

> **Long live the fighters.**
